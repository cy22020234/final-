Project Summary: The history of daydreaming goes back thousands of years, and today our leisure time is dominated by smartphones and a variety of devices - swiping social networks, listening to audio podcasts, sending and receiving emails - but our minds rarely have the opportunity to wander at will. This change may seem unobtrusive, but it can have a profound effect on the way we think and on our group creativity. In fact, it may even hinder our ability to generate innovative ideas. This project was based on a dream I had where there was a pink sky, a white horse flying in the sky, and I was sitting on a beach watching the view. I think dream scenes are considered to be sacred messages and a way to stimulate creativity. It is the last piece of paradise in our spiritual world, a brief escape from reality, where we can find the strength to move forward in balance. So I recreated the dream scene in its entirety.

I read in an article Daydreams at Work: Wake Up Your Creative Powers, Amy Fries, author and editor of Psychology Today, that when you can ramble, it gives you access to memories, emotions and random bits of knowledge. The white horse symbolizes holiness and purity. It symbolizes a vision of a better future, while allowing the mind to rest and relax can bring many benefits. The symbol shines through the ages. So in this project I compared the white horse to a ball, I subdivided the sphere into 128 widths and heights and transformed these vertices into details on the surface of the sphere. And change the shape of the object by means of musical input. In this project I used the perlin noise approach. And by timing it to match the music beat. People are aware of the overall state of mind through daydreaming, and when they are in a daydream state of mind, they can visualize various events. This visualization can help us gain a new perspective on a problem, or connect two previously isolated ideas to create a new vision.


Problems encountered in the project: The animation over time was not well solved, I tried to traverse each vertex but could not record the time, there was no way to control each vertex to make random changes, finally I chose to use the rotation method to change the trajectory of the sphere to show a sense of random upward movement. I also encountered the problem that the function could not be defined in the process of uploading the model, but the error was still reported in the process of changing my library. In the process afterwards but I will try it further.
